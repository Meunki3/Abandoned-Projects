# Abandoned Projects
 The start of my abandoned personal projects

7/20/23 Good Start Menu:

[-] An alternative windows start menu where user can select application path, and add it to their own custom list. Good Start Would have live cpu usuage, a screen recording shortcut, and access to shutdown or logout computer when user wants to. In summary, Just a really minimal start menu where the user can chose which apps to display.

â€‹	{r} stopped project because of  allowing users to located path to certain application. also, began project with horrible messy code. Will return to this project when more advanced in python.
